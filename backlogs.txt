* (Complete) ASMR Darling second submission.

* AsmrDarling.cs line 83, update the overlay source path to a raw one (s3 url).

* (Complete) RepeatIntentHandler needs to be implemented, handling the built in repeat intent.

* (Complete) Audio player & feature of the skill needs to be tested, on the phone and the echo (no display).

* Repeat intent should be added to the developer console. The request is being sent from Alexa only after
  the audio player has been launched.

* (Complete) Speech template needs to be updated with the "What would you like to do?" option.

* (Complete) Speech flow needs to be refined.

* APL video should be tested and implemented (should check if the user event request contains any meaningful
  information regarding the APL video player).

* Video url array should be added to the APL video (video player helper).

* Resolution is somehow not null even the given utterance is vague. Should be handling multiple queried items,
  but always ending up finding one item searched by the processed input (resolution).

* Perhaps, if the raw input & processed input have a non-matching rate of 50% or more, it will be a good idea
  to return the multiple item handler response.

* (Complete) Video mode added to user state map for delegating different types of videos.

* (Complete) Some speeches refined.

  unnecessary menu reloadings.

  request types (OnPause, OnEnd, etc..).
